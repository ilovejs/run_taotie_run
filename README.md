Run Taotie Run
==============

A mini game themed around Taotie monsters from our MMORPG [Here Be Monsters] (http://apps.facebook.com/herebemonsters).

For those unfamiliar with **Here Be Monsters**, `Taotie` is the name of a monster (a kinda odd poccessed bronze/ceramic pots that eats all it can find!) found in the east asia folklores and in the world of `Here Be Monsters`.

The objective of this mini game is to **avoid** the `Stariums` falling from the sky and survive as long as you can whilst accumulate as many as you can by:
* keeping more of your followers alive means your score go up quicker
* spend more time around the center of the screen to rack up score quicker
* collect random `Cheeries` before they disappear to get bonus points

some in-game hints:
